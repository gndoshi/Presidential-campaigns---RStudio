# Presidential-campaigns---RStudio
This is a self-implemented project on Financial Contributions to Presidential Campaign by residents of North Carolina! Let me know what you think and if you have any questions on the code, feel free to ask! Thank you. 

The data for this project is available for free on http://fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do. 

Edit: August, 2017 - I had completed this project in December, 2016 but recently, I used the 'ggmaps' package to make a nice map that shows the distribution of the contributions throughout the State of NC. This can be directly correlated, although I haven't explored that avenue, to the votes and see which areas in NC favor which candidate.
